A quick-access pull timer toolbar for **World of Warcraft 1.12** (Turtle WoW), with built-in raid target marking.
Requires the **BigWigs** addon with its Pulltimer plugin enabled.

You can also download BigTimer from OctoWoW's [Gitea](https://octowow.st/git/Fayz/BigTimer).

## Requirements
| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **BigWigs** | Must be loaded and enabled |
| **BigWigs Pulltimer plugin** | Must be enabled within BigWigs options |

## When the bar shows up
| Group | Who sees it |
|---|---|
| **Raid** | Raid leader or assist |
| **Party** | Party leader |

The bar hides itself when you are not in a group, or don't have the role above.

## Buttons
| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| **10 / 15 / 20 / 30 / 60** | Starts a BigWigs pull timer for that many seconds |
| **Break** | Starts a break timer (length is set in Settings). BigWigs always labels the bar "Pull" |
| **Ready** | Sends a ready check |
| **X** | Cancels the pull timer. If no timer is running, BigWigs starts a 6 second pull instead |
| **Cfg** | Opens the settings window |

## Raid Marks
A strip of the 8 raid target icons sits inside the bar, in order from Skull to Star (Skull is always on the left, or on top when the bar is vertical).

* **Left-click** an icon to put that mark on your target
* **Left-click the same icon again** to remove it
* **Right-click** any icon to clear your target's mark

The icons scale to fit the length of the bar and share its border.

## Settings
Click **Cfg** to open the settings window. You can drag it anywhere and close it with Escape.

* **Break Duration**: 1 to 10 minutes
* **Scale**: 25% to 200%. The bar stays in place while it resizes
* **Horizontal / Vertical**: switches the bar's layout
* **Lock Bar**: stops the bar from being dragged
* **Marks: Top / Bottom** (horizontal) or **Marks: Left / Right** (vertical): which side of the timer buttons the marks sit on. Each layout remembers its own side
* **Show Marks**: turns the raid mark strip on or off

The bar fades to 25% when your mouse isn't over it. All settings are saved per character.
